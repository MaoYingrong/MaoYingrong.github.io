I’m Yingrong Mao, and you can call me Abbey. I'm currently a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Science of Science and Innovation (CSSI) at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, and an MA candidate in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago, affiliated with the Knowledge Lab.  

My research lies at the intersection of complex systems, collective intelligence, and the science of science. I study how individuals, teams, and organizations explore and adapt in uncertain and interdependent environments—how scientists and innovators search for new ideas, how teams coordinate diverse expertise, and how these micro-processes shape large-scale patterns of knowledge production. I hope to connect these insights to questions about human–AI collaboration, the future of work, and how shared meanings and norms evolve in digital societies.  

Currently, I’m planning to pursue doctoral studies starting in Fall 2026. Please take a look at my [Projects](https://maoyingrong.github.io/Projects/) and [CV](https://maoyingrong.github.io/cv/), and feel free to reach out￼ if you’d like to discuss shared interests or potential collaborations — I’m always happy to connect.
